[CHEERFUL INTRO MUSIC]  
[CAMERA PANS TO MATT, SITTING ON A CHAIR, READING THE NEWS]  
[A TRUMPET WAILS]  

MATT: "Oh, what's this?"  
LETTERBOX LEONARD: "Illlletter!"  
MATT: "Huh, let's see what's in here.."  

[MATT OPENS THE LETTER]  

MATT: "Dear Matthew, my name is Pablo, I'm 5 years old and I'm
a soulmaker.  
Wow! Only 5 years old and already a soulmaker?! Let's read the rest of this..  

At night, I see my soulbuddy, Pawel, watch me while I sleep. It's been bothering me and I wish that he'd stop! What should I do?!

Love, Pablo."

[MATT FOLDS THE LETTER AND SIGHS, LOOKING AT THE CAMERA]

MATT: "Pablo, stuff like this happens all the time to little soulmakers like you and I, and look at me! I grew up just fine! Don't worry, my Angel doctors explained exactly what this was, it's really pretty simple! Come on, let's go!"  
MATT: "Oh Warper!"

-- 

[WARPER HANGS DOWN FROM THE CEILING, OVERLOOKING MATT]

MATT: "Hey Warper! How ya doin?"  
WARPER: "I'm bored, it's like an eternity in here.."  
MAIT: "Don't be so sad buddy, we're warping today!"  

[WARPER SIGHS]

WARPER: "Where to, Matthew?"
MATT: "Take us to the whiteboard room Warper!"

[CAMERA CUIS TO THE WHITEBOARD ROOM, EMPTY. MAIT'S VOICE IS
HEARD FROM ABOVE]

MATT: "Woooooooooooaaaaaaahh!"

[MATT LANDS SQUARELY ON THE FLOOR]

MATT: "Ouch.. Remind me to add a trampoline here next time!"
MATT: "Hey
thanks Warper!"

[WARPER GIVES MATT A THUMBS UP, AND ASCENDS OFF SCREEN]
[MATT DUSTS HIMSELE OFF]

MATT: "Phew, okay! Let's get to work!"

[WHITEBOARD THEME PLAYS, MATT DANCES AROUND THE FLOOR]

[WHITEBOARD THEME FINISHES]

MATT: "So; your soulbuddy actually exists right alongside you,
in your head! A little like, hmm, this;"

[MATT SCRIBBLES A BRAIN]

MATT: "Heres.•  
You guys.."

[MATT SCRIBBLES A DOI IN THE CENTER OF THE BRAIN]

MATT: "And heeres.. Your soulbuddy."

--

MATT: "Now! Why do they tend to appear when we're alone? Do
they just go away when someone's around? Are they shy?
Of course not! In fact, they're shy of you!"  
MATT: "When we're asleep, our brain goes into a rest mode. The
activity in our brain, the frequency, also called brainwaves,
relax; they become lower.. And slower.. And slower.."

[MATT YAWNS]

MATT: "Yaawn, aand slower. Until we fall asleep! What happens
then? Well, our soulbuddy occupies the little space that is
created when you fall asleep, because your brain isn't talking
as loudly as it was before!"

[MATT SCRIBBLES ARROWS COMING OUT OF THE DOT]

MATT: "And like this, they begin to appear in your eyesight.
So what should we do? Well, let them be! They won't harm you;
really, soulbuddies NEVER harm their soulbuddy, cause we're
all in it together!"  
MATT: "So you might be asking. So what do I do? Well I got a
song for you Pablo, written just for you! Hit it, Jukey Jake!"

["SLEEP SLEEP PABLO" PLAYS]

MATT: "  
When we gleep, when we sleep  
When we sleep and see a pal,  
When we sleep and feel some eyes!  

(Oh No!)  

Don't you fright, don't you fright,  
Go to sleep, go to sleep,  
Go to sleep and good night!  
Soulbuddy's here, to stayy.  

["SLEEP SLEEP PABLO" STOPS PLAYING]

MATT: "Phew. Took me a while to get that one down, it's too too catchy! "

MATI: "Alright guys! Thanks for tuning into another day with
me, I sure hope you'll come back soon, and maybe you and your
soulbuddy can watch together! Until next time where we discuss
what to do when we start to forget fun memories. See you
later!"
