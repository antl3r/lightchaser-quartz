title: It's just gas
---
Just above the scene between Lukas and his pursuer the steps of heavy
boots permeate the ceiling upon them. The larger operator approaches the
cornered woman shielding the crib, arms outstretched as if to make her own
barrier. She points the knife towards Jonathan in a shaky grip, pupils dilated to
adrenaline overdrive fear dominating every inch of her twitching muscles.

"Give me the knife, jessica." he says. Palms outward, as if calming a wild animal.

"Stay the fuck back!", her legs shift to gain footing, stabbing into the air.

"You turn yourself in, I will make sure your baby is safe." he says, stepping forward.

"How the fuck am I supposed to trust you?!"

"Kids don't deserve to die." He says. "What is his name?"
His hand floats towards her as he steps forward slowly.

"Jason." she utters in shaky breath.

"He's beautiful Jessica. He doesn't have to go."

He drags the gas tank behind him, the canister hits every seam on the flooring on the way. He pulls the piped inhalation mask and turns the valve dial to let out a faint hiss.
"Just gas, it'll make you sleep is all."
