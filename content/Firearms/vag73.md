title: Gerasimenko ВАГ-73
---
# Origin
- The ВАГ-73 is a Soviet experimental firearm.
- In real life, it was never mass-produced and exists only as a museum piece in Russia’s Artillery Museum.
- Sabujin stole the only existing copy from Angel Co.’s university armory while it was left out for cleaning. He gathered every component and assembled it himself.
- It later became Sabujin’s 19th birthday gift to Johnathan.

# Mechanics
- The VAG-73 uses 7.62 caseless, rocket-like ammunition. (No brass casings are ejected upon shooting)
- Ammunition is loaded and kitted at home; John is the only person in existence with tools capable of working with this ammo.
- It originally uses a tandem double-stack-like magazine system rated for 48 rounds. However, John’s customized caseless 7.62 uses both sides of the tandem magazine for a single round, reducing practical capacity to about 7 rounds.
- Despite the low capacity, each round has extreme stopping power — enough to kill an elephant inside a cruise ship.
- The tandem magazine system is mechanically complex, less like a Glock or 1911 and more comparable to a Desert Eagle.
- John’s customized version improves reliability over the original tandem concept.

# Drawbacks
- Severe overheating.
- Over-propulsion.
- Extreme rarity of ammunition.
- Low capacity due to customization.

# Notes
- John uses an unorthodox stance: hugging the front of the gun in a bicep-forearm choke inspired by old hunting doctrine. He values precision over volume of fire.
- The VAG-73 is an old Soviet weapon used in modern times, mirroring John’s personality: traditional, disciplined, and emotionally anchored in the present.
