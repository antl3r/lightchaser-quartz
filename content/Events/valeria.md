In events around 2034, all Demon Affairs operators lost their information link to Angel's central identification satellite, also known as the EYE IN THE SKY or EITS. Diagnostics controls returned completely normal values save for a malfunctioning accelerometer. The satellite, unbeknownst to the majority of the population, was blasted out of the sky with a cruise ship sized cannon situated a few kilometers off the coast Zhejiang, China. The PRC does not claim responsibility for the attack.
