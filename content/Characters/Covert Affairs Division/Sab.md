## Psychological Profile:
Sabujin Sabileye is a highly experimental and unstable individual. The strength in his operation relies widely on a variation of approaches rather than one, this makes him entirely unpredictable to opposing forces. A sheltered upbringing and later faced with overwhelming violence that had very short time of coping with bestows him a very repressed affect, highly emotional yet pressed down by the forces of surrounding adaptation. It is very likely that Sabileye suffers from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, if not a very high level of extraversion. He is a veritable prototypical intuitive user (see type below), caught up and hung up on extremely theoretical threats however practical he may seem under pressure. It is recommended to take additional caution, as his general repressed instability lays the foundation for his distorted somewhat grey morality. He
generally experiences very little remorse for inflicting pain.

## History
- Sab was born in Urssea to an Indonesian family which he ran away from at age 13.
- He had strange habits as a 6 year old. Running around outside and tasting objects. He was once taken to a therapist for a diagnosis but he answered them in a way that avoided most of the questionnaire's dsm modules.
- At school, he mostly skipped classes and played on the computers.
- One day during elementary school, Sab was picked on by some boys on the baseball team cause he got to join the boys school league despite not being born as one. They challenged him to batter up to prove that he's not better than the boys. Sabujin missed the fist two shots on purpose, and on the third, threw the bat until it hit the thrower, giving him brain damage. Ambulance was called and Sab got scolded. A few days later while the thrower is at the hospital, Sab brought his laptop and used their insecure network to shut down the electricity to the thrower's room. Turning off his life support and killing him. Nobody found out.
- After running away, he would squat on unused 2nd floors of convenience stores (ruko).
- He was taken under wing by youth activism gang 2S and played teen baseball leagues for sponsorship money.
